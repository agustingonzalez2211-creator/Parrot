# Spec JSON Iteration Flow

## Overview
Use a strict, implementation-gated workflow: functional JSON -> technical JSON -> todos JSON -> code.
Treat each JSON as an approval gate and do not skip gates.

## Mandatory Sequence
1. Scan repository context before asking questions.
2. Create `functional-spec.json` from user description.
3. Iterate functional JSON until approved.
4. STOP and ask the user explicitly if the functional spec is approved before continuing.
4. Create `technical-spec.json` from approved functional JSON.
5. Iterate technical JSON until approved.
6. STOP and ask the user explicitly if the technical spec is approved before continuing.
6. Create `todos.json` with dependencies and parallelization.
7. Implement code only after all three JSONs are approved.

## Step 0: Context Scan (Before Spec)
Inspect the app to avoid assumptions.

Minimum scan:
- `package.json` and scripts
- routing/entrypoints (`app/`, `src/`, `pages/`)
- current domain/data layer (`lib/`, `services/`, `api/`, `db/`)
- existing `specs/` and design tokens (`styles.json`, theme files)

Summarize:
- stack and runtime constraints
- current architecture shape
- touched modules likely affected
- test setup available

## Skill Routing by Feature Type
After scanning context, classify the request:

- Frontend-heavy: prioritize UI/UX skills first.
- Backend-heavy: prioritize API/domain/data skills first.
- Fullstack: split work in frontend/backend tracks and sync through shared contracts.

Routing rules:
1. Prefer already-available local skills in session.
2. If a required skill is missing and discoverable, use `find-skills`.
3. If no suitable skill exists, continue with explicit assumptions and standard engineering practices.

## JSON Contracts
Use JSON files in this exact order and keep them independent.

### 1) functional-spec.json
Include:
- product scope and in/out boundaries
- user journeys and use cases
- acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
- UX behavior and interaction expectations
- business rules (domain language, no implementation details)

Do not include:
- library picks
- folder-level code architecture
- implementation sequence

### 2) technical-spec.json
Include:
- architecture and module boundaries
- interfaces/contracts (data, APIs, state shape)
- dependency/library decisions with rationale
- failure modes and edge handling
- testing strategy and quality gates
- phased implementation plan (goal, tasks, dependencies, DoD)

### 3) todos.json
Include short executable tasks with:
- `id`, `title`, `owner_role`, `status`
- `parallelizable` boolean
- `depends_on` list
- `outputs` and `exit_criteria`
- execution batches (parallel vs sequential)

## Path Convention
Default output location:
- `specs/features/<feature-id>/functional-spec.json`
- `specs/features/<feature-id>/technical-spec.json`
- `specs/features/<feature-id>/todos.json`

## Iteration Rules
- Keep each JSON editable and versioned in place.
- Resolve functional ambiguities in functional JSON, not in technical JSON.
- Resolve architecture ambiguities in technical JSON, not in todos JSON.
- Keep todos short and operator-friendly for multi-agent execution.
- Never advance gates automatically: after each document draft/revision, wait for explicit user approval.
- Mandatory gate prompts:
  - After functional spec: ask if it is approved to move to technical spec.
  - After technical spec: ask if it is approved to move to todos/plan.
  - After todos/plan: ask if it is approved to start implementation.

## Implementation Gate
Do not implement code until:
- functional JSON approved
- technical JSON approved
- todos JSON approved
- each approval is explicitly confirmed by the user in conversation

When gate opens:
- implement in atomic commits by topic
- run tests and runtime checks
- report blockers with concrete file-level impact

## Quality Checklist
Before moving between gates, verify:
- requirements traceability: every scope item maps to AC
- technical traceability: every AC has a planned implementation path
- task traceability: every planned change appears in `todos.json`
- parallel safety: tasks marked parallel do not conflict on same files/modules
